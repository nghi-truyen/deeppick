  abstract = "{As the number of seismic sensors grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult for analysts to pick seismic phases manually and comprehensively, yet such efforts are fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Despite years of improvements in automatic phase picking, it is difficult to match the performance of experienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts may pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake locations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method called “PhaseNet” that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep neural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with sufficient training, have achieved super-human performance in many applications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and generates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals and noise as output. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in the probability distributions provide accurate arrival times for both P and S waves. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by analyst-labelled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. The data set we use contains more than 700 000 waveform samples extracted from over 30 yr of earthquake recordings. We demonstrate that PhaseNet achieves much higher picking accuracy and recall rate than existing methods when applied to the waveforms of known earthquakes, which has the potential to increase the number of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available. This will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity models.}",

abstract = {Abstract The important task of tracking seismic activity requires both sensitive detection and accurate earthquake location. Approximate earthquake locations can be estimated promptly and automatically; however, accurate locations depend on precise seismic phase picking, which is a laborious and time-consuming task. We adapted a deep neural network (DNN) phase picker trained on local seismic data to mesoscale hydraulic fracturing experiments. We designed a novel workflow, transfer learning-aided double-difference tomography, to overcome the 3 orders of magnitude difference in both spatial and temporal scales between our data and data used to train the original DNN. Only 3,500 seismograms (0.45\% of the original DNN data) were needed to retrain the original DNN model successfully. The phase picks obtained with transfer-learned model are at least as accurate as the analyst's and lead to improved event locations. Moreover, the effort required for picking once the DNN is trained is a small fraction of the analyst's.},

An implementation on conventional sequential computers is also proposed.This method relies on a systematic application of Huygens' principle in the finite difference approximation. Such an approach explicitly takes into account the existence of different propagation modes (transmitted and diffracted body waves, head waves). Local discontinuities of the time gradient in the first arrival time field (e.g., caustics) are built as intersections of locally independent wavefronts. As a consequence, the proposed method provides accurate first traveltimes in the presence of extremely severe, arbitrarily shaped velocity contrasts.Associated with a simple procedure which accurately traces rays in the obtained time field, this method provides a very fast tool for a large spectrum of seismic and seismological problems.We show moreover that this method may also be used to obtain several arrivals at a given receiver, when the model contains reflectors. This possibility significantly extends the domain of potential geophysical applications.}",

abstract = {We develop a fast sweeping method for the factored eikonal equation. By decomposing the solution of a general eikonal equation as the product of two factors: the first factor is the solution to a simple eikonal equation (such as distance) or a previously computed solution to an approximate eikonal equation. The second factor is a necessary modification/correction. Appropriate discretization and a fast sweeping strategy are designed for the equation of the correction part. The key idea is to enforce the causality of the original eikonal equation during the Gauss–Seidel iterations. Using extensive numerical examples we demonstrate that (1) the convergence behavior of the fast sweeping method for the factored eikonal equation is the same as for the original eikonal equation, i.e., the number of iterations for the Gauss–Seidel iterations is independent of the mesh size, (2) the numerical solution from the factored eikonal equation is more accurate than the numerical solution directly computed from the original eikonal equation, especially for point sources.}

    abstract = "{We introduce a new tomographic method for estimating velocity macro-models from seismic reflection data. In addition to traveltimes picked on locally coherent reflected events, the method requires that the associated local slopes of the events be picked simultaneously in the common-shot and common-receiver trace gathers. The data then consist of a discrete collection of traveltimes, positions and slopes for selected reflected events. Unlike traveltime tomography, picked events are only required to be locally coherent. It is not necessary to follow continuous arrivals all over the trace gathers. Indeed, the method does not require the introduction of interfaces in the model description.Several approaches of tomography using the slope have already been proposed. We present a unified formulation for slope tomography methods, in which the model is described by the velocity field and a set of ray-segment pairs associated with the reflected/diffracted events. We propose a new robust slope tomography method, which we call ‘stereotomography’. It consists of fitting all observed data (positions, slopes and traveltimes) to data calculated by ray tracing. There are no theoretical limitations in stereotomography for laterally heterogeneous velocity macro-models.Practically, traveltimes and slopes are picked on local slant stack panels. Ray multipathing can be accounted for since paths are discriminated by their associated slopes. The non-linear inverse problem is iteratively resolved by a local optimization. The Fréchet derivatives are estimated by paraxial ray tracing.Validation tests on 1-D and 2-D synthetic data are analysed. In the first 1-D example, we study the sensitivity of the method to model parameters (using a singular-value decomposition). The second 1-D example evaluates picking precision and shows that it is sufficient for constraining the velocity field. The last example is a 2-D application in which data are calculated directly by ray tracing. It shows the performance of the method in the presence of strong lateral velocity variations.}",
