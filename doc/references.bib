  abstract = "{As the number of seismic sensors grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult for analysts to pick seismic phases manually and comprehensively, yet such efforts are fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Despite years of improvements in automatic phase picking, it is difficult to match the performance of experienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts may pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake locations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method called “PhaseNet” that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep neural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with sufficient training, have achieved super-human performance in many applications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and generates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals and noise as output. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in the probability distributions provide accurate arrival times for both P and S waves. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by analyst-labelled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. The data set we use contains more than 700 000 waveform samples extracted from over 30 yr of earthquake recordings. We demonstrate that PhaseNet achieves much higher picking accuracy and recall rate than existing methods when applied to the waveforms of known earthquakes, which has the potential to increase the number of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available. This will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity models.}",

abstract = {Abstract The important task of tracking seismic activity requires both sensitive detection and accurate earthquake location. Approximate earthquake locations can be estimated promptly and automatically; however, accurate locations depend on precise seismic phase picking, which is a laborious and time-consuming task. We adapted a deep neural network (DNN) phase picker trained on local seismic data to mesoscale hydraulic fracturing experiments. We designed a novel workflow, transfer learning-aided double-difference tomography, to overcome the 3 orders of magnitude difference in both spatial and temporal scales between our data and data used to train the original DNN. Only 3,500 seismograms (0.45\% of the original DNN data) were needed to retrain the original DNN model successfully. The phase picks obtained with transfer-learned model are at least as accurate as the analyst's and lead to improved event locations. Moreover, the effort required for picking once the DNN is trained is a small fraction of the analyst's.},

space because SVR optimization does not depend on the dimensionality of the input
