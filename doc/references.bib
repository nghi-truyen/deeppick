  abstract = "{As the number of seismic sensors grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult for analysts to pick seismic phases manually and comprehensively, yet such efforts are fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Despite years of improvements in automatic phase picking, it is difficult to match the performance of experienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts may pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake locations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method called “PhaseNet” that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep neural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with sufficient training, have achieved super-human performance in many applications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and generates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals and noise as output. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in the probability distributions provide accurate arrival times for both P and S waves. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by analyst-labelled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. The data set we use contains more than 700 000 waveform samples extracted from over 30 yr of earthquake recordings. We demonstrate that PhaseNet achieves much higher picking accuracy and recall rate than existing methods when applied to the waveforms of known earthquakes, which has the potential to increase the number of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available. This will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity models.}",

abstract = {Abstract The important task of tracking seismic activity requires both sensitive detection and accurate earthquake location. Approximate earthquake locations can be estimated promptly and automatically; however, accurate locations depend on precise seismic phase picking, which is a laborious and time-consuming task. We adapted a deep neural network (DNN) phase picker trained on local seismic data to mesoscale hydraulic fracturing experiments. We designed a novel workflow, transfer learning-aided double-difference tomography, to overcome the 3 orders of magnitude difference in both spatial and temporal scales between our data and data used to train the original DNN. Only 3,500 seismograms (0.45\% of the original DNN data) were needed to retrain the original DNN model successfully. The phase picks obtained with transfer-learned model are at least as accurate as the analyst's and lead to improved event locations. Moreover, the effort required for picking once the DNN is trained is a small fraction of the analyst's.},

Such an approach explicitly takes into account the existence of different propagation modes (transmitted and diffracted body waves, head waves). Local discontinuities of the time gradient in the first arrival time field (e.g., caustics) are built as intersections of locally independent wavefronts. As a consequence, the proposed method provides accurate first traveltimes in the presence of extremely severe, arbitrarily shaped velocity contrasts.Associated with a simple procedure which accurately traces rays in the obtained time field, this method provides a very fast tool for a large spectrum of seismic and seismological problems.We show moreover that this method may also be used to obtain several arrivals at a given receiver, when the model contains reflectors. This possibility significantly extends the domain of potential geophysical applications.}",

By decomposing the solution of a general eikonal equation as the product of two factors: the first factor is the solution to a simple eikonal equation (such as distance) or a previously computed solution to an approximate eikonal equation. The second factor is a necessary modification/correction. Appropriate discretization and a fast sweeping strategy are designed for the equation of the correction part. The key idea is to enforce the causality of the original eikonal equation during the Gauss–Seidel iterations. Using extensive numerical examples we demonstrate that (1) the convergence behavior of the fast sweeping method for the factored eikonal equation is the same as for the original eikonal equation, i.e., the number of iterations for the Gauss–Seidel iterations is independent of the mesh size, (2) the numerical solution from the factored eikonal equation is more accurate than the numerical solution directly computed from the original eikonal equation, especially for point sources.}

In addition to traveltimes picked on locally coherent reflected events, the method requires that the associated local slopes of the events be picked simultaneously in the common-shot and common-receiver trace gathers. The data then consist of a discrete collection of traveltimes, positions and slopes for selected reflected events. Unlike traveltime tomography, picked events are only required to be locally coherent. It is not necessary to follow continuous arrivals all over the trace gathers. Indeed, the method does not require the introduction of interfaces in the model description.Several approaches of tomography using the slope have already been proposed. We present a unified formulation for slope tomography methods, in which the model is described by the velocity field and a set of ray-segment pairs associated with the reflected/diffracted events. We propose a new robust slope tomography method, which we call ‘stereotomography’. It consists of fitting all observed data (positions, slopes and traveltimes) to data calculated by ray tracing. There are no theoretical limitations in stereotomography for laterally heterogeneous velocity macro-models.Practically, traveltimes and slopes are picked on local slant stack panels. Ray multipathing can be accounted for since paths are discriminated by their associated slopes. The non-linear inverse problem is iteratively resolved by a local optimization. The Fréchet derivatives are estimated by paraxial ray tracing.Validation tests on 1-D and 2-D synthetic data are analysed. In the first 1-D example, we study the sensitivity of the method to model parameters (using a singular-value decomposition). The second 1-D example evaluates picking precision and shows that it is sufficient for constraining the velocity field. The last example is a 2-D application in which data are calculated directly by ray tracing. It shows the performance of the method in the presence of strong lateral velocity variations.}",

abstract = {A tomographic inversion procedure is described and applied to a synthetic three-dimensional (3-D) seismic refraction data set, demonstrating that tomography is capable of determining a densely sampled velocity model with large velocity contrasts. Forward and inverse modeling procedures are chosen to minimize the computational costs of the inversion. Parameterizing the linearized inversion using functions defined along the ray paths, simple backprojection with zero pixel size is shown to exactly solve the linear problem, producing the smallest model for the slowness perturbation. For small grid cells, simple backprojection closely approximates the exact solution and is a sufficient solution for an iterative nonlinear inversion. This eliminates the need to store or solve a large system of linear equations. Accurate first arrival travel times are rapidly computed using a finite difference algorithm. Forward modeling between each simple backprojection allows the procedure to correctly account for the locations of the rays. This becomes more important as the spatial resolution of the model is improved. The computational efficiency of the entire nonlinear procedure allows the model to be densely sampled, providing a spatially well-resolved 3-D tomographic image. The synthetic refraction survey is designed to be similar to a published 3-D survey over the East Pacific Rise. Tests based on this example and others show that 3-D tomography is capable of inverting a large travel time data set for detailed earth structure with large lateral velocity variations and is stable in the presence of noisy data.},

It is applicable to refraction, wide-angle reflection, normal-incidence and multichannel seismic data, and is best suited to a combination of these that provides good independent constraints on seismic velocities and interface depths. The inversion process seeks a layer–interface minimum-structure model that is able to explain the given data satisfactorily by inverting to minimize data misfit and model roughness norms simultaneously. This regularized inversion, and the use of smooth functions to describe velocities and depths, allows the highly non-linear tomographic problem to be approximated as a series of linear steps. The inversion process begins by optimizing the fit to the data of a highly-smoothed initial model. In each subsequent step, structure is allowed to develop in the model with successively greater detail evolving until a satisfactory fit to the data is obtained. Parameter uncertainties for the final model are then estimated using an a posteriori covariance matrix analysis. Smooth layer–interface models are parametrized using regular grids of velocity and depth nodes from which spline-interpolated interface surfaces and velocity fields are defined. Forward modelling is achieved using ray perturbation theory and a two-point ray tracing method that is optimized for a large number of closely-spaced shot or receiver points. The method may be used to generate 1- and 2-D models (from, for example vertical seismic profile data or 2-D surveys) in which the 3-D geometry of a survey is correctly accounted for. The ability of the method to resolve typical target structures is tested in a synthetic salt dome inversion. From a set of noisy traveltime data, the model converges quickly to a well-resolved final model from different starting models. The application of this method to real data is demonstrated with a combined 3-D inversion of refraction and reflection data which provide P-wave velocity constraints on the methane hydrate stability zone in the Cascadia Margin offshore Vancouver Island.}",

There are also cases in which both direct as well as reflected arrivals are important, such as in Vertical Seismic Profiling.

abstract = { Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a high-resolution seismic imaging technique that is based on using the entire content of seismic traces for extracting physical parameters of the medium sampled by seismic waves. The widespread strategy of seismic imaging, the single scattering formulation, at the core of FWI, assumes no prior scale in the model description. Each unexplained residual data sample at receivers for one source is assumed to come from any point of the medium, and only the summation over sources and receivers helps in locating medium property anomalies, regardless of what type of phase is involved. This pixel-oriented perturbation leads to the local optimization approach, which is a linearized differential approach based on the Newton equation. For a least-squares misfit function, there are both the gradient vector and Hessian matrix, in addition to approximations that can be considered for the related Newton equation. The forward problem of the wave propagation, used thousands of times during optimization, should be efficient, and these equations are expressed either as a first-order hyperbolic system of velocity-stress or as a second-order hyperbolic system of displacement (or velocity) only, by using a self-adjoint formulation in both cases. Gradient vectors are built as a zero-lag crosscorrelation in time between incident and adjoint wavefields with forward and backward patterns and also could be used for obtaining Hessian-matrix approximations. Resolution and uncertainties are relevant, although the actual state of the art does not provide meaningful estimation of these quantities: the FWI remains a deterministic approach at this time. An examplary North Sea data set from the Valhall reservoir illustrates the successful story for high-resolution imaging based on data-driven components, with paleorivers stored in sediments, imprints of glaciers in the bedrock, and gas clouds at different scales in the image. Alternative sources of information on the medium, such as sonic logs and geologic interpretation, are illustrated through a model-driven component of the misfit function. Although methods can be used to increase the speed of the workflow, they are quite costly. The multiparameter reconstruction, which is mandatory for elastic FWI, starts to be feasible if one improves the Hessian-matrix influence. Thus, FWI is becoming a mature strategy for high-resolution seismic imaging. },

abstract = { A method for velocity and interface depth determination based on tomography of migrated common reflecting point (CRP) gathers is presented. The method is derived from the tomographic principle that relates traveltime change along a given ray to perturbations in slowness and layer depths. The tomographic principle is used to convert depth errors in migrated CRP gathers to time errors along a CRP ray pair and thus enable use of conventional traveltime tomography. It is also used to affect a very fast prestack migration and set up the tomography matrix. The velocity‐depth determination method uses the available offsets of all CRPs and inverts for the parameters of all layers simultaneously. Hand picking of depth errors on CRP gathers is avoided by a method where the tomography matrix operates directly on the migrated gathers. The velocity‐depth determination method is demonstrated on a synthetic example and on a field example from the North Sea. },

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

abstract = { Abstract Recent advances in machine learning and its applications in various sectors are generating a new wave of experiments and solutions to solve geophysical problems in the oil and gas industry. We present two separate case studies in which supervised deep learning is used as an alternative to conventional techniques. The first case is an example of image classification applied to seismic interpretation. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to pick faults automatically in 3D seismic volumes. Every sample in the input seismic image is classified as either a nonfault or fault with a certain dip and azimuth that are predicted simultaneously. The second case is an example of elastic model building — casting prestack seismic inversion as a machine learning regression problem. A CNN is trained to make predictions of 1D velocity and density profiles from input seismic records. In both case studies, we demonstrate that CNN models trained from synthetic data can be used to make efficient and effective predictions on field data. While results from the first example show that high-quality fault picks can be predicted from migrated seismic images, we find that it is more challenging in the prestack seismic inversion case where constraining the subsurface geologic variations and careful preconditioning of input seismic data are important for obtaining reasonably reliable results. This observation matches our experience using conventional workflows and methods, which also respond to improved signal to noise after migration and stack, and the inherent subsurface ambiguity makes unique parameter inversion difficult. }

abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a model-based data-fitting technique that has been widely used to estimate model parameters in Geophysics. In this work, we propose an efficient computational approach to solve the FWI of crosswell seismic data. The FWI problem is mathematically formulated as a partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization problem, which is numerically solved using a gradient-based optimization method. The efficiency and accuracy of FWI are mainly determined by the three main components: forward modeling, gradient calculation and model update which usually involves the gradient-based optimization algorithm. Given the large number of iterations needed by FWI, an accurate gradient is critical for the success of FWI, as it will not only speed up the convergence but also increase the accuracy of the solution. However computing the gradient still remains a challenging task even after the adjoint PDE has been derived. Automatic differentiation (AD) tools have been proved very effective in a variety of application areas including Geoscience. In this work we investigated the feasibility of integrating TAPENADE, a powerful AD tool into FWI, so that the FWI workflow is simplified to allow us to focus on the forward modeling and the model updating. In this paper we choose the limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS) method due to its robustness and fast convergence. Numerical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and robustness of the new computational approach for FWI.},

Despite great advances in seismic data collection, the usage of seismic arrival times is still insufficient because of the overload manual picking tasks for human experts. In this work we employ a deep-learning method (PickNet) to automatically pick much more P and S wave arrival times of local earthquakes with a picking accuracy close to that by human experts, which can be used directly to determine seismic tomography. A large number of high-quality seismic arrival times obtained with the deep-learning model may contribute greatly to improve our understanding of the Earth's interior structure.},
